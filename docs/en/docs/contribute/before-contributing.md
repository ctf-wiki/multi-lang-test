# Before Contributing

You don't have to become a sophisticated CTFer before contributing to CTF Wiki. If you are enthusiastic about open source, and you enjoy sharing your piece of knowledge on CTF Wiki, please don't hesitate to join us.

When you maintain CTF Wiki, no one will assign tasks to you. Feel free to commit when you find something imperfect.

If you find that somewhere is not well-written, you can discuss with the authors and make it a more reasonable structure.

**Be sure to go over this guide before contributing.**
